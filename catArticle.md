In a move expected to create severe backlash from global fur-ball-rights groups, the director of the Siamese Organization said today that she is working with various unnamed regulators to tax fur-ball emissions over a certain threshold. Details are still emerging on taxable quotas, but a recent Institute of Cat Health study recommended capping free emissions at 25 fur balls per year for individuals, or 225 balls per year for per litter, which includes one parent. Opponents of the fur-ball tax argue that levies will serve to increase the illegal disposal of fur-balls, further harming the environment for dogs and other cat-compatible house animals.
